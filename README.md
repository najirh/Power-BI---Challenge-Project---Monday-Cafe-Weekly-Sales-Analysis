## 📋 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Monday Cafe Power BI Dashboard Challenge**! This project is based on a **real production use case** from our fictional UAE-based cafe chain — **Monday Cafe**. The company has **4 branches** across the UAE, serving 15 different products, and wants to analyze performance on a **weekly basis** (Monday → Sunday) using Power BI.

You are required to design an **interactive, dynamic, and insightful Power BI dashboard** that automatically shows the **last completed week’s** results and allows users to select a specific week or week range using a slicer.

The dataset provided contains **10,000 sales records** for the year 2025 (up to the current date).

## 🎯 Dashboard Requirements

### KPI Section

Create 3 key performance indicators (KPIs):

1. **Total Sales**
2. **Total Quantity Sold**
3. **Total Profit** [Any sales in dubai 15% profit, Abu Dhabi 12%, Sharjah 9%, Ajman 7%

Each KPI must include:

* The current week’s value
* The **% change vs. the previous week**
* A visual indicator (up/down arrow or color change)

> Example: The dashboard should show last Monday to last Sunday by default.

When the user selects a different **week range** from the slicer, the dashboard should update accordingly and compare that range to its **previous equivalent week range**.

---

### Charts to Include

1. **Pie Chart** — Product-wise sales contribution
2. **Line Chart** — Weekly sales trend (Week on X-axis, Sales on Y-axis)
3. **Bar Chart 1** — Branch-wise sales comparison
4. **Bar Chart 2** — Product-wise total quantity sold

---

### Slicer Configuration

* **Week slicer** should be based on a Monday → Sunday week range.
* By default, the report should display data for the **most recent completed week**.
* When users select any week or range, the dashboard should dynamically compare it with the **previous week(s)**.

## 🧩 Additional Notes

* Ensure the visuals are **clean, aligned, and professional**.
* Use consistent **color palette** and **font styles**.
